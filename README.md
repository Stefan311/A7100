# A7100
### What is the A7100?
It's an old computer from the east german "Robotron" company. See [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_7100)
### Why is the rest of this project in german language?
It's made for and with an german audience in mind. The A7100 is rare outside the former east german country anyway.
